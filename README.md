# Merit order for power plants in Europe

The source code of an interactive dashboard that allows you to explore the merit order of power plants in Europe. It plots the merit order (supply curve) of the respective power plants. It is using [JRC-PPDB](htps://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/joint-research-centre-power-plant-database-jrc-ppdb) which contains over 7000 individual power plants. You can parametrize the plot by selecting different countries (or combinations thereof), different fuel and carbon price. There is also an interactive map that you can overview the selected power plants as well as a reporting Table.
